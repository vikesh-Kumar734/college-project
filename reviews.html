    <p>Michel of Hialeah, this customer said that I have had sony headphones forever. 
    They are very sturdy and you can trust them. My kids dropped them several
    times and they keep working. For college students they are a plus because 
    come in many different formats. Very good job Dell. You have here a well
    satisfied customer. Thanks.</p>
