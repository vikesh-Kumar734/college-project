     <h2>Why Trust Us?</h2>
     <p>Our team of expert editors spends more than 400 hours per week researching products, conducting hands-on tests, interviewing industry pros, studying market research, reviewing consumer feedback, and writing up all our findings into digestible yet comprehensive reviews. We don’t use an algorithm or software to choose the products — they’re all hand-picked and researched or tested by us!</p>
     <br>
     <h2>Vision</h2>
     <p>The amount of research and testing for each piece of content varies, since some products involve more complex topics — like web cameras or mouses — while others allow us to flex our discovery and curation skills, like this piece on dorm room decor ideas or essential tailgate supplies for a brighter counter companion. Sometimes we get our hands dirty while we’re wrist-deep in the product-testing phase (like when we tested these Shittens wipes … yes, those are a thing), while other times you’ll find us drowning in dozens of browser tabs full of brand and product research.</p>
     <br>
     <h2>Consumer Satisfaction</h2>
     <p>We’ve reviewed more than 65,000 products since we launched, and we never recommend something we wouldn’t buy ourselves. We first conduct hours of research and initial product tests before finalizing our top picks within a category. Our editors spend days — sometimes weeks — researching and comparing several different models, reading consumer feedback, studying competitor coverage, calling in products, and hands-on testing across our team.</p>
